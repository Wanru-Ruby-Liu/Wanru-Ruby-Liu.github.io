I am Wanru Liu, a Ph.D. student in Health Services Research at Brown University School of Public Health. My research lies at the intersection of health economics, aging, and health policy, with a particular focus on Medicare, long-term care, and payment reform.

My academic and research experiences span across multiple institutions including Harvard Kennedy School, MIT Sloan, and Tsinghua University. I have conducted both quantitative and qualitative work in healthcare evaluation, payment systems, and chronic disease management.
