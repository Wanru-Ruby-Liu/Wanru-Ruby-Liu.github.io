    "text": "Experience\nI currently work with Dr. Eric Jutkowitz and Dr. Kali Thomas to examine Medicare Advantage and Fee-for-Service switching patterns among older adults transitioning into assisted living, using national datasets with a focus on dementia care policy. My previous work includes evaluating China’s 2017 provider payment reform using interrupted time series analysis, conducting simulation modeling at Boston Children’s Hospital, and leading meta-analyses on chronic disease interventions at Tsinghua University.\nEarlier in my academic career, I collaborated on large-scale data visualizations of Chinese philanthropic giving during the COVID-19 pandemic, and participated in clinical trials evaluating Traditional Chinese Medicine for schizophrenia. My undergraduate honors thesis explored how personality traits influence female college students’ perceived employability in China and the U.S."
