I am Wanru (Ruby) Liu, a Ph.D. student in Health Services Research at Brown University School of Public Health. My research lies at the intersection of health economics, aging, and health policy, with particular interests in Medicare, long-term care, and payment reform. I am especially passionate about understanding how healthcare systems adapt to population aging and how policy can better support older adults with chronic conditions such as Alzheimer's disease and related dementias.

## Experience

I currently work with Dr. Eric Jutkowitz and Dr. Kali Thomas to examine Medicare Advantage and Fee-for-Service switching patterns among older adults transitioning into assisted living, using national datasets with a focus on dementia care policy. My previous work includes evaluating China's 2017 provider payment reform using interrupted time series analysis, conducting simulation modeling at Boston Children's Hospital, and leading meta-analyses on chronic disease interventions at Tsinghua University.

Earlier in my academic career, I collaborated on large-scale data visualizations of Chinese philanthropic giving during the COVID-19 pandemic, and participated in clinical trials evaluating Traditional Chinese Medicine for schizophrenia. My undergraduate honors thesis explored how personality traits influence female college students' perceived employability in China and the U.S.
